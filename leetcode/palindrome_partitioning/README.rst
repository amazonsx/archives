Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.
For example, given s = "aab",
Return
[
["aa","b"],
["a","a","b"]
]


NOTE:
You may find that a slower algorithm with less space will get accepted on Leetcode.
While a faster algorithm with a table to memorize all calculated palindromes will get a Output Limit Exceeded on Leetcode.
