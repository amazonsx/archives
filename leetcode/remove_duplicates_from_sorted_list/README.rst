Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.

For example,
Given 1->1->2, return 1->2.
Given 1->1->2->3->3, return 1->2->3.


Thoughts:
Procssing is clear.
Read the current char, and check the next char.
Delete the duplicates until reach a different char.
